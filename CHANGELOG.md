# 1.0.10

Fixes

- Amount no longer needs to multiplied by 100 to get actual value. Enter the exact amount and user/customer gets charged exactly that amount.

- Inbuilt transaction reference generator based on uuidv4. See Readme example.

- Fixed Transaction Successful and Not Successful issue. Only Make sure you have a callback url in your paystack dashboard and be sure you have entered the same in the code as the callback url
